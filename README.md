# Deer and Elk Recognizer

 This AI can inform the user for which is which, when the user sees a deer or elk in the wild. This is very useful, as it can help people who are not very informed on these animals to learn more about them and help define these animals. This can be used by anyoone, from those who don't know much about these animals, to researchers, who are studying the animals for research purposes.

## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 

The algorithm of this project works by first inputting a dataset of both deer and elk. Then, the model sorts them from one another and puts them into two catagories, one is deer, and the other being elk. This dataset was put through the mode 35 times, also known as epochs, which helps maintain accuracy in determining the animal.
